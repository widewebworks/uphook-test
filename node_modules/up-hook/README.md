# up-hook

`up-hook` is an [up](http://github.com/learnboost/up) middleware that
enables zero-downtime reloads upon pushing to a GitHub repository
through a git-hook.

## How to use

1. **Add the up-hook middleware**

    ```js
    srv.use(uphook('/super-secret-url', { branch: 'master', cmd: 'make deploy' }));
    ```

    In this case it's set up so that when you push to the `master` branch,
    it will run `make deploy` and, if successful, it'll reload the server.

2. **Add the post-receive hook on GitHub**

    On GitHub, configure a post-receive hook pointing to the URL supplied
    in the middleware (e.g: `http://yourdomain.com/super-secret-url`)

3. **Enjoy!**

## Running the example

1. Create a new GitHub repository and copy the contents of `example/`.
2. Deploy the app by running `DEBUG="up-hook" node server`.
3. Load the page, it should say "Hi"
4. Point a GitHub post-receive hook to "yourdomain.com/tobi"
5. Commit some changes to `app.js` and push to master (eg: turn "Hi" into
   "Bye")
6. Your server will have been reloaded!

## API

```js
uphook (url, opts, fn)
```

- `url`: secret url (path + query string) to capture
- `opts`: options object
 - **branch**: `String|false` branch to capture (`master`)
 - **cmd**: `String` command to execute (`git pull`)
 - **cwd**: `String` optional dir to execute process in
- `fn` is called with an error if the command fails, or `null` if the
  reload is triggered
